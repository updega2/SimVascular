  * \class vtkSVIntegrateFlowThroughSurface - Integrates vector dot normal.
  * \brief First this filter finds point normals for a surface.  It
  * Takes a point vector field from the input and computes the
  * dot product with the normal.  It then integrates this dot value
  * to get net flow through the surface.
