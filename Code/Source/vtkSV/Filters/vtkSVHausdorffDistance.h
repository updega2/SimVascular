/**
 * \class vtkSVHausdorffDistance
 *
 * \brief This is a filter to calculate the average and hausdorff distances
 * between two surfaces. The first input is the source polydata and used as
 * the reference polydata. The algorithm processes each point in the second
 * input and calculates the distance of each point to the reference surface.
 * A vtkCellLocator is used for the distance calculation.
