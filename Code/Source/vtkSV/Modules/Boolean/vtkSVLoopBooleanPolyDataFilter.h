/**
 * \class vtkSVLoopBooleanPolyDataFilter
 *
 * \brief Computes the boundary of the union, intersection, or difference
 * volume computed from the volumes defined by two input surfaces.
 *
 * \details The two surfaces do not need to be manifold, but if they are not,
 * unexpected results may be obtained. The resulting surface is
 * available in the first output of the filter. The second output
 * contains a set of polylines that represent the intersection between
 * the two input surfaces.
 * The filter uses vtkSVLoopIntersectionPolyDataFilter. Must have information
 * about the cells on mesh that the intersection lines touch. Filter assumes
 * this information is given.
 * The ouput result will have data about the Original Surface,
 * BoundaryPoints, Boundary Cells,
 * Free Edges, and Bad Triangles
