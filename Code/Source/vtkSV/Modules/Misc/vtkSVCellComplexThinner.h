 *  \brief This is a filter to take a cell complex and perform iterative
 *  \brief thinning on it and return polydatas with cell data indicating the
 *  \brief absolute and relative persistance of each cell during the
 *  \brief iterative procedure
 *  \brief For more details on the method and the cell data see:
 *  \brief Liu, L., et al. "A simple and robust thinning algorithm on cell complexes."
 *  \brief Computer Graphics Forum. Vol. 29. No. 7. Blackwell Publishing Ltd, 2010.
 *  \brief Also, the corresponding edge pd can be retrieved in OutputEdgePd
