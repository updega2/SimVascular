/**
 *  \class vtkSVGetSphereRegions
 *  \brief This filter is intended purely for geometries with a branching
 *  structure with a cell data array defining the different branches of the
 *  geometry. It will find the boundary between these regions, find a centroid
 *  of the branching region, create a sphere around the branching region,
 *  and set the value to 1 in an output data array within this sphere region.
 *  CellArrayName holds the array that indicates whether a cell is in the sphere region..
 *  Points defining a boundary should be indicated with the PointArrayName. This
 *  can be easily found using the vtkSVFindSeparateRegionsFilter.
