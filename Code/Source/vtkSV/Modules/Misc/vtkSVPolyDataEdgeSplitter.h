/**
 *  \class vtkSVPolyDataEdgeSplitter
 *  \brief This filter performs edge splits around given points. The purpose
 *  of this filter is to increase the valence of a point. It can create worse quality
 *  triangles as the valence can then be above the ideal size connected cells. This
 *  can be useful in clustering algorithms where multiple regions need to meet at
 *  a single point.
