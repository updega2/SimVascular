/**
 * \class vtkSVPointSetBoundaryMapper
 *
 * \brief This filter is derived from vtkSVBoundaryMapper to implement a
 * special plane boundary where it is actually set up to define a rectangule;
 * however, the boundary points do not necessarily all have to be corners.
 * That is set by defining the number of divisions in each length of the
 * rectangle.
